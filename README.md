# Own-SSR

This vite project was scaffolded with `bun`.

## Exploring SSR Frameworks

The aim of this project is to understand a bit more how SSR framework such as `next.js` work under the hood.

I'm following this relatively old article to guide my exploration:
[Building an SSRFramework using vite and Prisma](https://zach.codes/p/building-an-ssr-framework-using-vite-prisma)

I want to understand how hydration work with React SSR, and how much complexity id demands to use `renderToPipeableStream` instead of `renderToString`.
